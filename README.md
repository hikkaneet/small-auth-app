## Application

### Purpose
The application is a simple user authentication and management system.

### Features
- **User Registration**: Users can register with a username and password.
- **User Login**: Users can log in to receive an access token.
- **User Management**: Users can be created and managed through the API.

## Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Tortoise ORM)
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 with Bearer Token
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt
- **Frontend**: React (or any modern JavaScript framework)
- **HTTP Server**: Uvicorn
- **Environment Management**: Local (for development)

## Detailed Breakdown

### Backend (FastAPI)

#### Role
Handles API requests, performs authentication, and manages user data.

#### Components
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /token/`: Authenticates users and returns an access token.
  - `POST /users/`: Creates new users.
- **Models**: Defined in `app/models.py` using Tortoise ORM.
- **Schemas**: Defined in `app/schemas.py` for data validation and serialization.
- **Authentication**: Implemented in `app/auth.py` using OAuth2 and bcrypt for password hashing.

### Database (PostgreSQL)

#### Role
Stores user data securely.

#### ORM
Tortoise ORM is used to interact with the PostgreSQL database.

#### Models
Represented in `app/models.py` with fields for `id`, `username`, and `hashed_password`.

### Frontend (React)

#### Role
User interface for interacting with the FastAPI backend.

#### Components
- **Login Form**: Allows users to enter their credentials.
- **Registration Form**: Allows users to create new accounts.
- **User Management Interface**: Displays and manages user data.

### HTTP Server (Uvicorn)

#### Role
Serves the FastAPI application.

#### Configuration
Listens on `127.0.0.1:8000` and enables auto-reload during development.

### Environment Management

#### Local Development
The application runs locally on the developer's machine using environment variables for configuration.

## Summary

The application is a simple FastAPI backend that provides user registration and authentication via OAuth2. The data is stored in a PostgreSQL database using Tortoise ORM. The backend is served using Uvicorn, and the frontend (React) interacts with the backend API to perform user operations. The stack is designed for local development and is suitable for building a user authentication system.
